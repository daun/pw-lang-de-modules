# German language pack for ProcessWire Modules

German (de_DE) language pack for [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com) third-party modules. Uses formal language ("Sie").

**This language pack contains translations for popular third-party modules. The actual core translations are dealt
with by the [official de_DE language pack](https://github.com/jmartsch/pw-lang-de) which you'll want to install first.**

The repository will (try to) be up to date with the most recent **stable** version of each module.

## Installation

See the [instructions of the main language pack](https://github.com/jmartsch/pw-lang-de) for installation details.
