# German language pack for ProcessWire

German (de_DE) language pack for [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com). Uses formal language ("Sie").

The repository will (try to) be up to date with the most recent **dev** version of ProcessWire.

Pull requests are welcome. Let's try to work together, to get fast updates of the german language pack when a new stable version is published.
