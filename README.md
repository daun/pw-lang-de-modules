# German language pack for ProcessWire Modules

German (de_DE) language pack for [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com) third-party modules. Uses formal language ("Sie").

**This language pack contains translations for popular third-party modules. The actual core translations are dealt
with by the [official de_DE language pack](https://github.com/jmartsch/pw-lang-de) which you'll want to install first.**

The repository will (try to) be up to date with the most recent **stable** version of each module.

## Installation

See the [instructions of the main language pack](https://github.com/jmartsch/pw-lang-de) for installation details.

## Contribute

You have discovered a spelling mistake? You have a suggestion for an alternative word? Or a translation makes no sense at all?

Great, then follow the instructions in the [processwire-language-pack-helper](https://github.com/jmartsch/processwire-language-pack-helper) repo.

It comes with a full ProcessWire installation and allows you to easily update the translations.
