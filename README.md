# German language pack for ProcessWire

German (de_DE) language pack for [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com). Uses formal language ("Sie").

The repository will (try to) be up to date with the most recent **dev** version of ProcessWire.

Pull requests are welcome. Let's try to work together, to get fast updates of the german language pack when a new stable version is published.

## How to help updating the language pack (draft, not ready yet)

Look for abandoned and empty phrases.
abandoned are not needed any more and can safely be removed
empty phrases are new additions, which need to be translated
changed word "tag" and "tags" to "Stichwort" and "Stichworte"
